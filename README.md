# ‚ú® World Layoffs - MySQL Data Analysis Project

## üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global layoffs data using MySQL. The objective is to uncover insights into layoff patterns across industries, countries, and companies, highlighting trends and key factors influencing workforce reductions.

## üéØ Objective
The main goals of this project were to:
- Analyze the impact of global layoffs across industries, companies, and countries.
- Explore patterns related to total layoffs and workforce percentage reductions.
- Derive actionable insights for stakeholders, including policymakers, analysts, and business leaders.
- Enhance my proficiency in SQL and data analysis through real-world application.

## üìÅ Files Included
1. **World Layoffs.csv**: The dataset containing information about layoffs worldwide.
2. **World Layoff MySQL project Data Cleaning query file.sql**: This file contains the SQL queries used for data cleaning and preprocessing, including:
   - Removing duplicates
   - Standardizing data formats
   - Handling null values
   - Data normalization and transformation
3. **World Layoff MySQL project EDA query file.sql**: This file includes the exploratory data analysis queries, including:
   - Identifying maximum layoffs and percentages
   - Analyzing company-wise layoff trends
   - Exploring date ranges and temporal patterns

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Did
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Used MySQL to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted in-depth analysis using SQL queries to explore trends and patterns in layoffs data.
- **Insights Generation**: Derived insights related to industry impacts, geographical trends, and company-specific layoffs.

## üîç Key Insights Explored
- **Maximum Layoffs**: Identified the maximum number of employees laid off and the highest percentage of workforce reduction.
- **Top Companies by Layoffs**: Analyzed companies with the most significant layoffs.
- **Industry Trends**: Explored which industries were most affected by layoffs.
- **Geographical Insights**: Analyzed country-wise layoffs to understand regional impacts.
- **Temporal Trends**: Examined date ranges to uncover trends over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **MySQL**: For data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.
- **Excel**: For preliminary data exploration and validation.

## üìä Analysis Points
- Companies in the tech and retail sectors experienced the highest layoffs.
- Certain regions faced more significant workforce reductions, possibly due to economic downturns or industry-specific challenges.
- A noticeable trend of increasing layoffs was observed during economic uncertainties.
- Companies at later business stages (e.g., Post-IPO) showed higher layoff rates, potentially due to restructuring or cost optimization.

## üöÄ Why This Project?
I undertook this project to:
- Enhance my data analysis skills using MySQL.
- Gain experience in working with real-world datasets and deriving actionable insights.
- Showcase my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize complex data.
